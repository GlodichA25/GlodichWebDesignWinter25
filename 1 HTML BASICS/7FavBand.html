            <hr>
            <p><strong>The Beatles</strong> is my favorite band for many reasons.</p>
<p>First off, they have a variety of songs with many different vibes. Throughout their time making music, their music style has changed in very interesting ways.</p>
<p>I have never come across a song of theirs that I didn't enjoy.</p>
<p>Second, there is a song for every mood that you might be feeling. Since they have such a variety, I can basically always listen to them no matter what my mood is.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think that the Beatles have some of the most genius song writers in the band. They have great lyrics and excellent skills in creating songs.</p>
<!--My favorite member of The Beatles is George Harrison.-->
