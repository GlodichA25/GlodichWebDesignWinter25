        <body>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to my "About Me" page! My name is Audrey Glodich. I 
               am 17 years old and my birthday is May 16, 2007. I have a wide 
               variety of interests such as music, crafts, cats, jets, and playing
               the ukulele! I have an 8 year old tabby cat named Pebbles. My 
               goals for the future are to attend a ollege where I can hopefully
               recieve a good education in a science major, with end goal of 
               being in the forensic science field. I also strive to succeed in 
               Air Force ROTC during college, so that I can become an officer in 
               the Air Force. It has always been one of my dreams to be in the 
               military, and this is the path I want to take. I am a friendly and
               humble person who is also more on the quiet side, butonce I get to
               know someone I can be funny and more interesting. Down below, here 
               are a few of my favorite things!</thead></p>
