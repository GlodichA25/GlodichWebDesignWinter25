           <h2>All About These Creatures</h2>

           <h4> Saltwater crocodiles can be found in many areas of the world, specifically Southeats Asia, India's eastcoast, and Australia. These crocodiles are huge, with the average male measuring up to 17 feet. However, they can grow up to 23 feet long! They can weight as much as 2,200-3,300 pounds.  </h4>
       <h2>Habitat & Diet</h2>
       <h4>Saltwater crocodiles tend to live in mangrove forests, beaches,
         rivers, estuaries, and even the ocean! They are cold blooded so 
         they enjoy laying in the sun, and when they get too hot they 
         submerge themselves in the water, leaving their eyes and nostrils
          slightly above it. Crocodiles are nighttime hunters. They are
           carnivores, and will grab just about any meat that they can 
           find. </h4>
          <h2>Hunting & Behavior</h2>
           <h4>Saltwater Crocodiles are very agressive and territorial 
            compared to other crocodiles, especially when it comes to
             hunting. They communicate with chirping and growling.
            A unique way that crocodiles hunt is by sticking their claws 
          above the water. This can look funny, but it is actually them 
          trying to hunt for fish. Special receptors in their hands are 
          able to detect movement in the water. By doing this they use 
          less energy trying to catch fish since they are fast, and 
          instead they wait for the fish to come to them. 
        Once crocodiles catch larger prey, they preform the "death roll". 
        Once grapping their prey with their sharp teeth and drowning it, 
        they hold on and start rolling it around in order to remove its 
        limbs easier. </h4>

<h4>One man heavily associated with crocodiles is Steve Irwin! He is known as
  "The Crocodile Hunter". Therefore, one cool place to see real saltwater
