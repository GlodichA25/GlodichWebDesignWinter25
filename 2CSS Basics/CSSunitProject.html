     <h3 style="background-color: rgb(254, 254, 155);"> As someone who loves music, especially older music, collecting vinyl 
        records is one of my favorite things to do. It is such a different and
        refreshing way to listen to music. The hunt for your favorite record in 
        many stores and finally finding it is the best feeling!</h3>
